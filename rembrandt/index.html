              Rembrandt van Rijn, more commonly known simply as Rembrandt, was
              one of the most famous and prolific artists in history. He left
              behind over two thousand known works of art using a variety of
              media – ninety of which are self-portraits. His life is a
              rags-to-riches-to-rags story, with more than its share of
              misfortune.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rembrandt was a Dutch painter active during the Baroque period.
              Known as the Dutch "Golden Age," this was an affluent time for the
              Dutch people, whose ships sailed around the world, bringing exotic
              trade goods back to their ports. Citizens throughout the
              Netherlands enjoyed their new, middle-class affluence and spent a
              good deal of money on art in a market quite similar to our own.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Protestant northern Europe, artists were unable to depend on
              the Catholic church for commissions, as their counterparts did in
              Italy and Spain. As a result, they were dependent on private
              patrons who demanded portraiture and other works depicting
              commonplace scenes from contemporary Dutch life, known as genre
              paintings.
            </p>

            <p>
              Always a stubborn man, Rembrandt decided early that he wanted to
              be known as a history painter, illustrating scenes from the Old
              and New Testament and from classical mythology. At the time, this
              was considered to be the most noble and important form of
              painting, though its market was necessarily limited due to the
              greater sums of money required for the production of these
              larger-than-life paintings. Rembrandt’s “insensitivity” to trends
              in the art market probably contributed to his eventual financial
              ruin, but it also gave him the freedom to produce some of the most
              profoundly timeless images in the history of art.

          <h2>The Tragedy That Was Rembrandt's Family</h2>
          <p>
            Even in a time where death was far more commonplace than it is
            today, few people, let along artists, have endured the personal
            tragedies that Rembrandt experienced during his lifetime. The son of
            a miller and the eighth of nine children, here are some milestones
            from his lifetime:
