            <p>
              Saskia van Uylenburgh (August 2, 1612 – June 14, 1642) was the
              wife of painter Rembrandt van Rijn. During the course of her life
              she was the model for a number of his paintings, drawings and
              etchings. She was the daughter of a Frisian mayor and the niece of
              Rembrandt’s art dealer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Saskia and Rembrandt were engaged in 1633, and on June 10th, 1634
              Rembrandt asked permission to marry her in Sint Annaparochie. He
              showed his mother's written consent to the schepen. On July 2nd
              the couple married. The preacher was Saskia's cousin, but
              evidently none of Rembrandt's family attended the marriage. That
              Saskia fell in love with an artist who was socially no match for
              the daughter of a patrician and that she pressed for a speedy
              betrothal against all conventions reveals that she was a strong
              and independent character. In 1635 the couple moved to one of the
              posh streets in Amsterdam, the Nieuwe Doelenstraat, with prominent
              neighbors and a view of the river Amstel.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rembrandt achieved financial success through his artwork, and
              decided in 1639 to buy a house in the Jodenbreestraat, next to the
              place where he worked. A year before, Saskia's Friesian relatives
              had complained that Saskia was wasting her inheritance on the
              purchase. Rembrandt asked his brother-in-law Ulricus van
              Uylenburgh, who was also a lawyer, for help, and he confirmed that
              Rembrandt was indeed successful and therefore able to pay for the
              house.
            </p>

            <p>
              Three of their children died shortly after birth and were buried
              in the nearby Zuiderkerk. The sole surviving child was Titus, who
              was named after his mother's sister Titia (Tietje) van Uylenburgh.
              Saskia died the year after he was born, aged 29, most likely from
              tuberculosis. She was buried in the Oude Kerk. For the next ten
              years Rembrandt focused primarily on his drawings and etchings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Saskia’s will allowed Rembrandt to use their son's inheritance as
              long as he never remarried. If Titus died without issue, Rembrandt
              would be the heir of their property. Rembrandt hired Geertje Dircx
              as a wetnurse and in 1649 she expressed her expectation that he
              would marry her. Her plans went awry when, sometime during the
              following year, Rembrandt had her shipped off to the poor house.
              Hendrickje Stoffels became his new housekeeper and mistress. In
              1662 Rembrandt, having been in severe financial trouble for
              several years, was forced to sell Saskia's grave.

          <h2>The Tragedy That Was Rembrandt's Family</h2>
          <p>
            Even in a time where death was far more commonplace than it is
            today, few people, let along artists, have endured the personal
            tragedies that Rembrandt experienced during his lifetime. The son of
            a miller and the eighth of nine children, here are some milestones
            from his lifetime:
