            <p>
              Hendrickje Stoffels (1626 – July 21, 1663) was Rembrandt’s
              longtime friend with benefits. The couple were forbidden to marry
              because of the financial settlement linked to the will of
              Rembrandt's deceased wife Saskia, but they remained together until
              Hendrickje's death. In the later years of their relationship
              Hendrickje managed Rembrandt's business affairs together with the
              painter's son Titus.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hendrickje is widely believed to have modeled for a number of
              Rembrandt's works, though her role as Rembrandt's model is
              disputed by some critics. In 1656 Rembrandt was forced to declare
              bankruptcy and in 1658 he lost his house. He, Hendrickje, their
              daughter Cornelia, and Titus moved into a rented property. In the
              same year, Hendrickje, who got along well with Titus, opened an
              art shop with Titus’ help where she sold Rembrandt’s paintings. In
              order to protect Rembrandt from his money lenders, Hendrickje and
              Titus became his “employers.” In this way Hendrickje Stoffels, his
              former maid, had become his boss – at least officially. Her
              biographer Christoph Driessen believes that Rembrandt’s noticeable
              productivity in the early 1660s was enabled by the obvious support
              Hendrickje was rendering him. She essentially organized his life
              and prevented his complete downfall after his bankruptcy.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1663, the plague hit Amsterdam and killed thousands. Hendrickje
              died suddenly at this time, suggesting that she was a victim of
              the epidemic. She was buried in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam on
              24 July 1663. Titus also died five years later, making Rembrandt’s
              life a stereotypical rags-to-riches-to-rags story. It’s seems
              obvious why he appears so sad in many of his late self-portraits.

          <h2>The Tragedy That Was Rembrandt's Family</h2>
          <p>
            Even in a time where death was far more commonplace than it is
            today, few people, let along artists, have endured the personal
            tragedies that Rembrandt experienced during his lifetime. The son of
            a miller and the eighth of nine children, here are some milestones
            from his lifetime:
